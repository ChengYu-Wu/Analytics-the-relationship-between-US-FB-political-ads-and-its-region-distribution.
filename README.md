Analytics the relationship between US FB political ads and its region distribution.


Big data analytics is the less-cost way to deal with a large amount of data and
uncover meaning, patterns and other messages hidden. It can be used in lots areas,
for example, business. If the company wants to gauge customer needs and customer
satisfaction through analysing all of customers’ purchase records in every store and
other channels in a long period, it will need big data analytics with a distribution
system, a computing environment supporting calculating tasks across multiple
computing devices which can work parallelly, and offering an efficient way to deal
with complex, massive and even unstructured datasets.
Of course, big data analytics and distribution systems are suit for analysing Facebook
political advertisements for finding their region distribution. Look at FB political
dataset file, I noticed that ads were not posted averagely in every region. As a result,
I would like to analyse the advertisements’ region distribution in each US state in
2021, and trying to find reasons.
To figure out what caused the region distribution of ads, I would deal with their title,
body, funding entity and link caption. Besides, I compared region distributions
between two related link captions, "winred.com" and "secure.actblue.com", trying
to find the differences between them.
